Simu5G is a simulator for 5G NewRadio and LTE/LTE-A networks for OMNeT++ and INET frameworks.

Simu5G simulates the data plane of the 5G RAN and core network. It allows simulation of
5G communications in both Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) and Time Division Duplexing (TDD) modes,
with heterogeneous gNBs (macro, micro, pico etc.), possibly communicating via the X2 interface to support
handover and inter-cell interference coordination. Device-to-device communications and Dual Connectivity
between an eNB (LTE base station) and a gNB (5G NR base station) are also available.

Simu5G is the result of a joint research project carried out by Intel Corporation and
the Computer Networking Group of the University of Pisa, Italy
