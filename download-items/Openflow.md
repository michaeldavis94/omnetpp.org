Simulation model of the OpenFlow system based on the OpenFlow switch
specification 1.0, developed at the University of Würzburg.

Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a new paradigm for communication networks
which separates the control plane from the data plane of forwarding elements.
This way, SDN constitutes a flexible architecture that allows quick and easy
configuration of network devices. OpenFlow is currently the most prominent
approach which implements the SDN concept and offers a high flexibility in the
routing of network flows.

The model was originally presented at the 6th International Workshop on OMNeT++
(Cannes, 2013) by authors Dominik Klein and Michael Jarschel, for INET-2.0 and
OMNeT++ 4.2.

Porting to newer OMNeT++ and INET versions has been done by other teams in forked
GitHub repositories:

* <https://github.com/inet-framework/openflow> (semi-official)
* <https://github.com/CoRE-RG/openflow> (OMNeT++ 5.5.1 and INET 3.6.6, also extended for use with CoRE models)
* <https://github.com/danhld/openflow> (OMNeT++ 5.1 and INET-3.6.0)
