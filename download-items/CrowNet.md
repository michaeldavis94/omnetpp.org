CrowNet is an open source simulation framework for the development of new
networked mobility concepts and intelligent transportation systems. CrowNet has
been developed as part of the roVer research project at Munich University of
Applied Sciences that is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and
Research (Grant number: 13FH669IX6).

CrowNet builds on state-of-the-art simulation frameworks for simulating mobile
networks (OMNeT++, INET, VEINS, Artery, Simu5G) and mobility behavior (VADERE,
SUMO). CrowNet extends these frameworks with several features, such as:

* Detailed pedestrian mobility
* Bi-directional interactions with pedestrian mobility
* Sidelink-based crowd monitoring
* App based crowd management
