FLoRa (Framework for LoRa) is a simulation framework for carrying out end-to-end
simulations for LoRa networks. It is based on the OMNeT++ network simulator
and uses components from the INET framework as well.

FLoRa allows the creation of LoRa networks with modules for LoRa nodes,
gateway(s) and a network server. Application logic can be deployed as
independent modules that are connected with the network server. The network
server and nodes support dynamic management of configuration parameters through
Adaptive Data Rate (ADR). Finally, the energy consumption statistics are
collected in every node.
