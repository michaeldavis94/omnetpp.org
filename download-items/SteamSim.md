STEAM-Sim establishes a hardware/software/network co-simulation of wireless sensor networks.

Original C code is used in simulation. The code is natively executed by the CPU
where the simulation is run. The time annotation engine annotates the C source
code used for simulation with the timing information as if the code is run on a
microcontroller. The annotation process is fully automated.

Hardware models are developed using the PAWiS framework and reflect the timing,
functionality, and energy-consumption of real-world hardware such as a CC2420
radio transceiver.

Network behavior in terms of wireless channel models are provided by the PAWiS
and the MiXiM framework.

STEAM-Sim is an extension to the PAWiS and MiXiM framework. The underlying
simulator is OMNeT++. Please see the corresponding documentation.

Contiki v2.6 operating system was also ported to STEAM-Sim, thus it is possible
to run Contiki-based code in the simulation.
