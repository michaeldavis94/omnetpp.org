This is a new fork of INET Framework developed for hybrid networking research.
The INET-HNRL provides new models in both optical and wireless networking areas
and their hybrid. Currently, the following models and research frameworks have
been implemented:

- Models for the hybrid TDM/WDM-PON under the SUCCESS-HPON architecture
- Framework for the equivalent circuit rate (ECR)-based study of next-generation
  optical access (NGOA) architectures
