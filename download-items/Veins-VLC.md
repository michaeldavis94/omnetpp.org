Veins VLC extends Veins vehicular network simulation framework with channel
models for Vehicular Visible Light Communication (V-VLC). It enables the
investigation of different aspects of V-VLC networks, including a range of
different applications (e.g., platooning), higher layer protocols (e.g., medium
access) and heterogeneous networks combining V-VLC and IEEE 802.11p DSRC.

Recent advances in Light Emitting Diode (LED) technology have lead to the
adoption of LEDs in exterior automotive lighting. The fast switching property of
LEDs allows data transmission over the visible light medium. If combined with
adequate receivers, e.g., high frequency photodiodes, camera image sensor,
visual light communication becomes possible.

Developed at the Telecommunication Networks Group, Technical University of Berlin.
