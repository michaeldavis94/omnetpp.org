CoRE4INET is an extension to the INET Framework for the event-based simulation
of real-time Ethernet in the OMNeT++ simulation system.

Currently CoRE4INET supports:
- TTEthernet (AS6802)
- IEEE 802.1 Audio Video Bridging (AVB) / Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)
- IEEE 802.1Q / IEEE P802.1p VLANs and Priorities

Note: INET Framework, from version 4.4, already contains support for TSN modeling, written based on the experiences of Core4INET.
