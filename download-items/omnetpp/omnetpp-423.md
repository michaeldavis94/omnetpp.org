This is a modernized version of omnetpp-4.2.2 that makes it possible to build and use the now 11-year-old package in today's software environments. The primary objective of this release is to facilitate the execution of old simulation models, e.g. for reproducing simulation results or as a basis of porting them to more recent versions of OMNeT++.

This release does not contain a download for Windows.
