The focus of version 4.5 was to improve the usability of the Graphical Runtime
Environment (Tkenv). The Tkenv GUI has been redesigned for single-window mode to
improve usability and user experience. Tkenv has also received a new, modern
look and feel, due to the use of the Ttk widgets and a custom Ttk theme.
