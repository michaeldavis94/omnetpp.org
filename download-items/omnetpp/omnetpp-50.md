Release 5.0 is a result of development effort of nearly two years. This is a
major release that introduces significant new features compared to the last 4.x
version, for example the Canvas API (2D graphics), OpenSceneGraph-based 3D
graphics support, improved logging, a new Qt-based runtime environment that will
eventually replace Tkenv, and much more.

We have also taken the opportunity of the major release to improve several
corners of the OMNeT++ API, and also to get rid of deprecated functionality. For
porting models from OMNeT++ 4.x, see doc/API-changes.txt which lists all
changes, with hints on how to update the model code.
