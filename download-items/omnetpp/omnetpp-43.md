This release contains several bugfixes and usability improvements compared to
4.2.2. Among other improvements, indexing of big C++ projects got considerably
faster and it is now possible to create scalar statistics from other statistic
values. Read the ChangeLog (after the More link) to see the complete list what
4.3 has to offer compared to version 4.2.
