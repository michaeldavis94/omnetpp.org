This is a modernized maintenance release of omnetpp-5.0. The primary objective of this release is to facilitate the execution of old simulation models, e.g. for reproducing simulation results or as a basis of porting them to more recent versions of OMNeT++.

This release does not contain a download for Windows so please use the 5.0 version if you need Windows support.
