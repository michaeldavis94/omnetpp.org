This is a modernized version of omnetpp-3.3.1 that makes it possible to build and use the now 17-year-old package in today's software environments. The primary objective of this release is to facilitate the execution of old simulation models, e.g. for reproducing simulation results or as a basis of porting them to more recent versions of OMNeT++.
