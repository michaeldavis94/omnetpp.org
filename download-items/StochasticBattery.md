An OMNeT++ simulation for stochastic battery behavior. It implements the
Stochastic Battery Model by Chiasserini and Rao.

This is a standalone simulation model which is of little use in itself, but
could be integrated into INET Framework.

Documentation is available
[in the repo](https://github.com/brandte/stochastic_battery/blob/master/stochastic_battery_documentation.pdf).
