StreetlightSim is a research project at the Pervasive Systems Centre, University
of Southampton which is developed specifically to evaluate Autonomous and
Adaptive Street Lighting Schemes based on Road User's presence detection over
wireless sensor networks (WSN).  StreetlightSim has been used to evaluate the
performance of various street lighting schemes based on an actual streetlight
network in terms of their energy efficiency and utility (a performance metric to
measure the usefulness of street lighting to road users)

Features:
- Based on OMNeT++ and SUMO.
- A customisable road traffic pattern which is described by the road traffic
  distribution according to different times of day and annual average daily
  traffic flow (AADF).
- Ease of extension to different streetlight networks using OpenStreetMap and JOSM.
