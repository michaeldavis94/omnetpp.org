NDNOMNeT is an extension for OMNeT++ to simulate Named Data Networking (NDN) in
IoT systems. It allows to quickly simulate and visualize NDN scenarios for
research and teaching purposes. It includes a base implementation of NDN
entities, simple forwarding strategy over wireless networks and typical NDN
applications.

The repo contains a modified version of INET-3.5.0 with NDN components added,
for example under src/inet/networklayer/ndn/.

The project was presented at the [5th OMNeT++ Community
Summit](https://summit.omnetpp.org/archive/2018/), and received *Best Community
Contribution* award. (Slides and paper behind the link.)
