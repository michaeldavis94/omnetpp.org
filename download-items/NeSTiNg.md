NeSTiNg is a simulation model for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). It uses
the INET Framework and enhances it by TSN-capable components.
The model was initially developed by a group of students during a curricular
project and is continously extended at the Distributed Systems group of IPVS,
University of Stuttgart.

David Hellmanns, one of the simulation authors, presented NeSTiNg at the
September 2018 IEEE 802.1 Working Group interim meeting in Oslo, Norway;

Note: INET Framework, from version 4.4, already contains support for TSN modeling, written based on the experiences of NeSTiNg.
