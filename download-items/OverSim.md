OverSim is an open-source overlay and and peer-to-peer network simulation
framework for the OMNeT++ simulation environment. The simulator contains
several models for structured (e.g. Chord, Kademlia, Pastry) and
unstructured (e.g. GIA) peer-to-peer protocols.

OverSim was developed at the Institute of Telematics, Universit√§t Karlsruhe (TH)
within the scope of the ScaleNet project funded by the German Federal Ministry
of Education and Research.
