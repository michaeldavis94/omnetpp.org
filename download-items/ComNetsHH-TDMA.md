A simple and abstract implementation of a TDMA MAC protocol for the INET
Framework. It divides time into time slots which are then grouped into frames.
For every frame a schedule is created which dictates to nodes when to send. In
this model, only the transmission of data is modelled. Control information is
assumed to be exchanged out of band, yielding a strongly idealized model.
