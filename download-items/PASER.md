PASER stands for Position Aware Secure and Efficient Mesh Routing and describes a novel efficient secure routing protocol for wireless mesh networks. The protocol aims to achieve an acceptable trade-off between security and performance of the routing process in wireless mesh networks. The protocol has been designed at the communication networks institute headed by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Christian Wietfeld at the TU Dortmund University in Germany.
