A simulation framework developed for the
[GrADyS](http://www.lac.inf.puc-rio.br/index.php/gradys/) (Ground-and-Air
Dynamic sensors networkS) project. This framework allows the simulation of
interconnected network nodes and the implementation of UAV swarms and sensor
coordination strategies with the objective of managing these autonomous UAV
swarms to collect sensor data on the field autonomously and efficiently.
