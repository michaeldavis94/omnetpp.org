This is a simulation of LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), a
well-known cluster-based protocol for sensor networks with an extension to make
it solar-aware.

This simulation was created for the following paper:

Thiemo Voigt, Hartmut Ritter, Jochen Schiller, Adam Dunkels, and Juan
Alonso. Solar-aware Clustering in Wireless Sensor Networks. In
Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications,
June 2004.

Abstract:

"Energy conservation plays a crucial in wireless sensor
networks since such networks are designed to be placed in
hostile and non-accessible areas. While battery-driven sensors
will run out of battery sooner or later, the use of renewable
energy sources such as solar power or gravitation
may extend the lifetime of a sensor network. We propose to
utilize solar power in wireless sensor networks and extend
LEACH, a well-known cluster-based protocol for sensor networks
to become solar-aware. The presented simulation
results show that making LEACH solar-aware significantly
extends the lifetime of sensor networks."
