<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Analysis tool: added support for computed scalars. Read the updated the
    User Guide for further details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Analysis tool: added <em>Logarithmic X axis</em> option to scatter chart.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added NED editor support for named channels.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added support for opening files from the command line, i.e. use:
    $ omnetpp Aloha.ned
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added full screen mode (Ctrl-Shift-F11).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Usability improvements in the Analysis Tool.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Better error reporting in the Sequence Chart and Event Log views.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The CDT C++ code analyzer has been turned off as it was reporting
    too many false positives.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The IDE has been switched over to use CDT’s DSF debugger instead of
    the older CDI.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The IDE no longer runs the C/C++ Indexer before build (the code now
    collects the information for makefile dependency generation by other
    means)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added pretty printing of STL containers (std::map, etc), simtime_t
    and other objects to the debugger; see the updated User Guide for
    details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Updated the bundled MinGW (GCC, linker and GDB).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Updated to Eclipse 3.8.1; the IDE now requires Java 1.6+.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>NED:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added named channels support, e.g. "…←→ eth1: EthernetChannel ←→…",
    with the purpose of making it easier to address channel objects when
    assigning parameters from ini files. Channel definitions can now specify
    a default name (via the @defaultname property), too.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Sim:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added the cPatternMatcher and cMatchExpression utility classes to the API.
    cPatternMatcher is a glob-style pattern matching class. cMatchExpression
    builds on top of cPatternMatcher and lets you combine patterns with AND,
    OR, NOT for matching fields of arbitrary objects.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added hasEncapsulatedPacket() to cPacket.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Implemented calculateWeightedSingleShortestPathsTo() in cTopology.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Signals implementation now allows static initialization of simsignal_t
    variables.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed a bug in Expression where <em>-2m</em> was evaluated to <em>2</em> (meter was lost)
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tools:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The simulator now supports Mac OS X 10.8 (you need to install XQuartz; see
    the Install Guide)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Simplified makefile output: Makefiles now output only the filenames to the
    console instead of whole commands. This makes the build output less noisy.
    If you need the old behavior, use the <em>V=1</em> (verbose on) option on
    the make command line.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
