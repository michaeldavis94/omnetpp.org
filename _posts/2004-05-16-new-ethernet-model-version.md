  0.95</A> adds auto MAC address assignment, auto-configuration of transmission rate
  and duplex/half duplex mode, support for all frame types (Ethernet II, 802.3 with
  LLC, 802.3 with SNAP), and uses OMNeT++ 3.0a4's controlInfo(). Sports a demo model

  technologies. </P>\r<P>This model is also&nbsp;suitable as a stress test for the
