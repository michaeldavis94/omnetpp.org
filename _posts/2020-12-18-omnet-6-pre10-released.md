We are very happy to announce that OMNeT++ 6.0 preview 10 has been released
(along with some compatibility updates in INET). Please use INET 3.7.0, INET
4.2.2 or INET 4.3.0 if you are working with preview 10 or later.

This prerelease contains many small changes and improvements. Additionally, due
to improvements in the toolchain and the build process, Windows users may see
the linking time of large models like INET Framework to drop dramatically (1-2
orders magnitude, e.g. from several minutes to several seconds).
