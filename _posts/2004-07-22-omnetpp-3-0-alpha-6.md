New features introduced in this release, in nutshell: enhanced wildcard
resolution in omnetpp.ini; direct support for XML config files via the "xml" NED
parameter type; Cmdenv now lets you choose which modules' ev output you want to
print; plugin interface for using configuration data sources other than
omnetpp.ini. Several improvements in opp_neddoc and opp_makemake (hi Daniel!),
and some bugfixes.
