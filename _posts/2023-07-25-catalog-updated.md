We have updated the [model catalog](/download/models-and-tools) with several new models:
[ComNetsHH-TSCH](/download-items/ComNetsHH-TSCH.html) (Wireless Avionics Intra-Communications model using IEEE 802.15.4 TSCH mode),
[ComNetsHH-RPL](/download-items/ComNetsHH-RPL.html) (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks, RFC 6550),
[ComNetsHH-TDMA](/download-items/ComNetsHH-TDMA.html) (an abstract TDMA MAC protocol for INET),
[ComNetsHH-ML](/download-items/ComNetsHH-ML.html) (materials on how to use Machine Learning frameworks in OMNeT++),
[CrowNet](/download-items/CrowNet.html) (framework for simulating pedestrian communication over mobile networks in urban and rural environments),
[GrADyS-SIM](/download-items/GrADyS.html) (framework for simulating cooperating swarms of UAVs in a joint mission, communicating through RF radios),
[MimicNet](/download-items/MimicNet.html) (predicting the performance of large-scale data center networks),
[Veins-Gym](/download-items/Veins-Gym.html) (exports Veins simulations as OpenAI Gyms to allow using reinforcement learning in the VANET domain),
[Veins-VLC](/download-items/Veins-VLC.html) (realistic simulation of vehicular visible light communication),
[WVSN](/download-items/WVSN.html) (simulation model of a wireless video sensor network).

Please take a look and let us know if you have any other models or tools that should be added.
