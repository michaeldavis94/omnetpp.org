excerpt: I've added couple of animation new features to Tkenv, such as <i>animation
  of sendDirect()</i>, <i>animation of method calls across modules</i>, marking the
  <i>location of the next/current event</i> in the network graphics, <i>display of
  queue size</i> as a number next to the module icon in the network graphics, <i>display
  of transmission/reception range</i> of wireless nodes, and <i>using icons for messages</i>.
  The features have been announced in the mailing list, with screenshots. Other recent
  improvements are the filtered object dialog (also announced on the mailing list)
  and saving/restoring all settings in the .tkenvrc file.
