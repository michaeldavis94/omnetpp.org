We are very happy to announce that OMNeT++ 6.0 preview 11 has been released
(along with some compatibility updates in INET). Please use INET 3.7.1, INET
4.2.3 or INET 4.3.1 if you are working with preview 11 or later.

This prerelease contains many small changes and improvements. The highlight of
this release is the Sequence Chart tool in the IDE which has been revised and
significantly extended with new functionality. NOTE: the eventlog (.elog) file
format has changed in a non-backward-compatible way.
