  adds spanning tree support to Ethernet switches (both STP and RSTP), several new
  routing protocols (RIP, GPSR, DYMO), a NetFilter hook API to facilitate the implementation
  of reactive routing protocols and several other tasks; an improved DHCP model; CMT,
  NAT and IPv6 support for SCTP; and contains many other improvements and bug fixes.
  <br /><br />INET is an open-source communication networks simulation package for
  the OMNeT++ simulation environment. It contains models for several wired and wireless
  networking protocols, including UDP, TCP, SCTP, IP, IPv6, Ethernet, PPP, 802.11,
  MPLS, OSPF, and many others.<br /><br />Visit the INET Framework website to <a target="_blank"
