excerpt: "<P><B>ReaSE</B> is an open-source network simulation framework for OMNeT++.
  ReaSE is able to create realistic simulation environments with respect to hierarchical
  network topologies, self-similar background traffic, and attack traffic based on
  real attack tools.</P>\r<P>The ReaSE framework provides a graphical user interface
  for generation of ned files including a realistic topology and necessary traffic
  generation entities. In addition, OMNeT++ and the INET framework are extended in
  a way that hierarchical routing and traffic generation are enabled within a user's
  simulation model.</P>\r<P>ReaSE is developed at the Institute of Telematics, University
  of Karlsruhe. This tool is actively developed and open to feedback and contributions.
  If you have any questions regarding ReaSE, feel free to contact the authors.</P>\r<P>For
  more information and to download the package, visit the <A href=\"https://projekte.tm.uka.de/trac/ReaSE\">ReaSE
