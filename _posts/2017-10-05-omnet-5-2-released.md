We are happy to announce the release of OMNeT++ 5.2. Highlights of this release are
the fine-tuning of result recording and processing (especially around weighted statistics);
many bug fixes and improvements in Qtenv; makefile changes to allow DEBUG and RELEASE builds
of models to co-exist, and several related changes in the IDE.
