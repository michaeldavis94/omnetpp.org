I would like to announce for them that in our paper, "BeeHive: An Efficient and Fault Tolerant Routing Algorithm Inspired from Bee Behavior", we used OMNeT++ for implementing BeeHive and comparing with AntNet and DGA. The paper won the best paper award at a prestigious Swarm Intelligence conference ANTS2004 in Brussels. The paper is available on-line [see above]."</P>
