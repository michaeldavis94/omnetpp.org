We are happy to announce the release of OMNeT++ 5.4.1. This release contains
last-minute features and improvements, mostly motivated by the upcoming INET 4
release. Highlights are the typename and exists() operators in NED; nan and inf
keywords in NED; support for logarithmic units like dB, dBW, dBm, dBV, dBmV.
Qtenv has also gained much more powerful just-in-time debugging capabilities
than before.
