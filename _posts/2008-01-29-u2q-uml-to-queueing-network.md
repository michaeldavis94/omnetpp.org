excerpt: "<p><b>U2Q</b> is a tool developed by <i>Lukas Pustina</i> at University
  Bonn. U2Q allows developers to estimate the performance of a system prior to prototypes,
  based on UML models only.</p>\r\r<p>The tool implements a design methodology that
  allows developers to estimate the performance of a system in very early stages of
  development where no prototypes are yet available. Starting from a functional UML
  system model, the developer enhances the system model by incorporating performance
  annotations. From this performance aspects enhanced system model, U2Q generates
  Queueing Networks as performance models which then may be analysed using analytical
  or simulative approaches. The tool itself smoothly integrates into Telelogic Tau
  G2 3.1 and brings a command line version.</p>\r\r<p>Documentation, screenshots and
