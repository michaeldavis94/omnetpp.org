author: Andras
excerpt: This alpha release introduces a new tool, <STRONG><EM>Scalars</EM></STRONG>
  for analysing output scalar (.sca) files. Scalars requires BLT. Another novelty
  is the new <STRONG><EM>"control info"</EM></STRONG> field in cMessage which provides
  a better way to implement communication between protocol layers than the traditional
  "interface packet" approach used in older IPSuite versions. (IPSuite has also been
  switched over to employ the control info approach.) And some bugfixes, e.g. opp_nedtool's
  broken network diagram export with some Ghostscript versions. [no longer available
  for download, get more recent versions instead]
