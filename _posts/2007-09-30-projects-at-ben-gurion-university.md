Last year we have activated several projects
In my research group<br>
1. A new MAC protocol for ad hoc networks<br>
2. An IEEE 802.16-2004 and IEEE-802.16 e compliant simulation modules for both SS and BS.

<br>This year we continue with<br>
1. developing the routing layer for wireless ad-hoc networks that will make an efficient use of our MAC protocol<br>
2. construct a research on resource allocation for MESH networks under the IEEE-802.16 E standard
<br>
Another research group is using OMNET++ to simulate the activities of network processors in high speed networks
