excerpt: "<b>Castalia</b> is a Wireless Sensor Network simulator for early-phase algorithm/protocol
  testing built at the <b>Networks and Pervasive Computing</b> program of <b>National
  ICT Australia</b>. It supports realistic channel and radio models, a key element
  for accurate early-phase WSN\rsimulation. It provides support for defining versatile
  physical processes. It also supports enhanced modeling of the sensing devices and
  other often-neglected attributes of a WSN such as node clock\rdrift. Download and
  documentation at:\r<a href=\"http://castalia.npc.nicta.com.au\">http://castalia.npc.nicta.com.au</a>."
