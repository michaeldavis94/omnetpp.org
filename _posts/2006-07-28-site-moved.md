  you experience any glitches, problems on the website, on mailing list etc. please
  let us know about it and drop a mail to rudolf.hornig at omnest dot com. One known
  issue: during the transfer of the mailing list, we have lost the mailing list user
  options including the user passwords. If you want to modify your options, please
  go to the mailing list options page at http://lists.omnetpp.org/mailman/listinfo/omnetpp-l
