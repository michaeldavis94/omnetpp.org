excerpt: <b><a href="https://projekte.tm.uka.de/trac/OppBSD/">OppBSD</a></b> is an
  effort to get the network stack of the actual FreeBSD kernel working in OMNeT++
  as a simulation model. In the model, every simulated host (or router) runs its own
  copy of the FreeBSD kernel's networking stack, and every host (or router) has its
  own copy of all state variables of the FreeBSD kernel. Presently, the package covers
  the full TCP/IP stack including ICMP, ARP, sockets and Ethernet frames. It also
  allows one to dump internal kernel variables of the tcp control block (e.g., windows
  sizes, ssthresh, etc.) into an OMNeT++ vector file for later analysis and also provides
  to dump pcap files for analysis with standard tools like tcpdump or WireShark (formerly
  known as Ethereal).
