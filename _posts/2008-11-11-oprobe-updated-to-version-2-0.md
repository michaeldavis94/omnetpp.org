excerpt: "<P>The simulation community has been accused for producing many simulation
  studies of bad quality. The mission of the oProbe open source project is to provide
  an instrument that produces statistically sound results at known quality. Stochastic
  sampling from a network of queues demands both confidence and correlation control.
  An important design goal is to be compatible with the OMNeT++ framework without
  introducing changes to this code, as well as making it easy for existing simulators
  to make use of oProbe. The oProbe project introduces a probe module, which is a
  new simple module in the context of OMNeT++. A probe is the instrument that applies
  a controlled stochastic sampling technique. The probe module may have any number
  of probes. The oProbe project supports different interface levels according to the
  functionality required. Based on the FIFO queue example included in the sample directory
  in OMNeT++, the oProbe project provides example code on how the software can be
  used by existing or upcoming OMNeT++ based simulators.</P>\r<P>You can download
  the manual and the source code here: <A href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/oprobe/\">http://sourceforge.net/projects/oprobe/</A>.</P>\r<P> </P>"
