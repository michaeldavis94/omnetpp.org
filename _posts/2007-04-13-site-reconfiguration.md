excerpt: "<P>Dear users,</P>\r<P>Because of bandwidth abuse on the site, we were forced
  to limit the number of incoming parallel http requests from a single IP address
  to 3. This means that if you try to open more than&nbsp;3 connections from the same
  IP address, you will get a Service Temporary Unavailable message from the server.
  This should not be a problem if you have your own IP address, however people behind
  NAT share a single IP. We are looking for a better resolution, but for the moment
  we think it is better to live with this limitation than having a nonfunctional site.
  </P>\r<P>We are sorry for this inconvenience... </P>"
