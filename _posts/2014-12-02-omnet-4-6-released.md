We are happy to announce the latest version of OMNeT++. Highlights of this
release: simulation models are now compiled as C++11 sources; we have upgraded
the Windows toolchain to MSYS2 and the latest MinGW (this will resolve
long-standing issues with the INET build process on Windows); the debut of the
opp_test program; and the rewrite of opp_msgc as part of nedtool. There were
also numerous bug fixes.
