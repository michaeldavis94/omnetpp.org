We are happy to announce the 3.2 version of OMNeT++. This release brings
database support, several improvements in the GUI tools (GNED, Plove, Scalars,
Tkenv), increased performance (via reference counting of encapsulated messages),
simplifications and refinements in the C++ API (eliminated the need for
Module_Class_Members(); more powerful WATCHes; new handleParameterChange() hook
method) and several further bugfixes and improvements.
