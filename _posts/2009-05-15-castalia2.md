Castalia 2.0 (for OMNeT++ 3.x) has been released. Castalia is a
simulator for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Body Area Networks (BAN),
and generally networks of low-power embedded devices. It offers an
advanced channel model based on empirical measurements that supports
mobility and temporal variability. It also offers many features that
are often neglected in network-level simulation, such as realistic
radio modeling and access, node clock drift, and physical process
modeling. Castalia is an expandable, modular and user-friendly
simulator with a growing research community. For more info go to <a href="http://castalia.npc.nicta.com.au/">http://castalia.npc.nicta.com.au</a>.
