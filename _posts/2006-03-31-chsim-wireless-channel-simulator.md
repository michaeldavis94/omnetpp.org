excerpt: <A href="http://typo3.cs.uni-paderborn.de/en/research-group/research-group-computer-networks/projects/chsim.html"><STRONG>Chsim</STRONG></A>
  is a project at University Paderborn to develop an OMNet++ simulation which generates
  channel state values (1/attenuation) in dB for a single wireless cell. This cell
  includes one base station and <I>N</I> terminals, each terminal can have <I>M</I>
  unidirectional links to the base station. For each of these links channel state
  values can be generated in the time and frequency domain. These values can be written
  to a file or processed in own simulation modules. <FONT size=2>The simulator includes
  several mobility and channel models.</FONT>
