excerpt: This work has been carried out at the <A href="http://www.unipd.it/en">University
  of Padua</A> within the research program <STRONG>"Methods and instrumentation for
  performance measurement in real-time networks"</STRONG>, supported by the Italian
  Ministry for University and Research (MiUR). The <A href="http://www.dei.unipd.it/ricerca/gmee/xsim">X-Simulator</A>
  is able to reproduce typical sources of uncertainty that may affect the performance
  of synchronization protocols in a network. In particular, it focuses on the Precision
  Time Protocol (PTP) IEEE 1588. See the <A href="http://www.dei.unipd.it/ricerca/gmee/xsim">project
  website</A> for further info.
