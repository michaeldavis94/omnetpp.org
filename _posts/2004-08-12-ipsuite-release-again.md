excerpt: "<FONT size=2>\r<P>This snapshot officially introduces the new TCP, which
  has taken the place of the older TcpModule everywhere. It now has apps (TCPSessionApp,
  TCPSinkApp, TCPEchoApp, etc.) as well as classes for convenient handling of connections
  from apps: TCPSocket, TCPSocketMap, etc. On the IP layer, there's an all-in-one
  IP model now, with lots of internals changed (e.g. fragmentation buffer rewritten).
  Network&nbsp;interfaces are now dynamically registered by L2 modules&nbsp;such as
  PPPModule. There's support for auto address assigment and autorouting. </FONT>[<A
