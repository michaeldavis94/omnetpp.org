OMNeT++ 4.3.1 is now available for download. With this update, we made it a lot
easier for first-time users to get started with OMNeT++: on the first startup,
the IDE shows some useful bits of information, and also offers installing the
INET Framework. In addition, the update also contains some bug fixes and smaller
improvements to the Simulation IDE. There is no change in the simulation kernel
and tools.
