We are proud to announce that after a development of nearly two years, OMNeT++
5.0 is now available for download. This is a major release that introduces
significant new features compared to the last 4.x version, for example the
Canvas API (2D graphics), OpenSceneGraph-based 3D graphics support, improved
logging, a new Qt-based runtime environment that will eventually replace Tkenv,
and much more. We have also taken the opportunity of the major release to
improve several corners of the OMNeT++ API, and also to get rid of deprecated
functionality.
