After more than 3 years of intense work of the team, 8 beta releases and two
release candidates, OMNeT++ 4.0 has been finally released. (We'd like to take
the opportunity to congratulate ourselves for this great achievement! :) With
the new Eclipse-based IDE, greatly enhanced NED language and simulation kernel,
and tons of other improvements, 4.0 is guaranteed to redefine the way you do
simulations with OMNeT++, and it will open up new horizons.
