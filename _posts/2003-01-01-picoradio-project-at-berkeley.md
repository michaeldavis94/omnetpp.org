excerpt: The PicoRadio project at Berkeley is aiming at developing "meso-scale low
  cost (< 50 cents) transceivers for ubiquitous wireless data acquisition that minimizes
  power/energy dissipation.". The NAMP subgroup are using OMNeT++ to model parts of
  the system. They have built an IEEE802.11 model, etc. <a href="http://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Pico_Radio/">http://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Pico_Radio/</a>
