excerpt: "<P><A href=\"http://wwwse.inf.tu-dresden.de\">Systems Engineering Group</A>
  @ TU Dresden uses the OMNeT++ discrete event simulation system for two of its current
  projects. </P>\r<P><B>PoDS</B> stands for <A href=\"http://wwwse.inf.tu-dresden.de/index.php?language=English&amp;site=courses&amp;course=ws05vl05\">Principle
  of Dependable Systems</A> and it is a class focusing on principles of how to design
  distributed protocols for dependable systems. Among many issues covered are: \r<OL>\r<LI>How
  can we design dependable systems? \r<LI>How can we make sure that a program is correctly
  executed? \r<LI>How can we tolerate hardware failures? \r<LI>How can we synchronize
  processes in a distributed system? </LI></OL><BR>We use OMNeT++ for creation of
  protocol templates which are later extended by students so as to meet the requirements
  presented during the lecture \r<P></P>\r<P><B>haps</B> stands for <A href=\"http://wwwse.inf.tu-dresden.de/~zib/projects/haps/haps_en.html\">Highly
  Available Publish/Subscribe</A> which is a project focusing on the issues of high
  availability of distributed systems using publish/subscribe services. We especially
  address the issues of computational limitations of the network routers and potential
  link failures when low bandwidth links are used for backup. We propose a novel scheme
  for coping with the problem of load shedding and service availability in the P/S
  scheme, where the users compete with each other for the access to the system resources.
  We are using the OMNeT++ simulation environment for the purpose of testing of our
  algorithms. </P>"
