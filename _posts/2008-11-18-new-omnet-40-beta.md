We are happy to announce the beta 8 release of OMNeT++ 4.0. In this release, we
made makemake generation a lot more flexible in the IDE, implemented frequently
asked features in Tkenv (run until event, log  window filtering), and resolved
several issues. We also created a Wiki page for OMNeT++ 4.0-related resources.
