excerpt: "<P><STRONG>PAWiS</STRONG> (Power Aware Wireless Sensors) is an OMNeT++-based
  simulation framework for the optimization of&nbsp;wireless sensor networks (WSN).
  The simulator has been developed within the PAWiS project&nbsp;at the&nbsp;Institute
  of Computer Technology, University of Technology, Vienna. WSNs&nbsp;require nodes
  with exceptionally low power consumption, yet have to drive sensors and radio communication.
  Common optimization approaches concentrate on modules to make every module as good
  as possible, but this approach only reveals local optima. In contrast, the PAWiS
  Framework targets on cross layer and cross module optimization to find global optimum.</P>\r<P>For
