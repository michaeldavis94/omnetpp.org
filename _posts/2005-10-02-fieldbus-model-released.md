<P>Regards, Dragan.</P><P>FIELDBUS is the result of my diploma thesis at&nbsp;University Dortmund in Germany. The goal was to create a reuseable control networks simulation software and to evaluate the properties of OMNeT++.</P>
<P>FIELDBUS is released under the General Public License v2.&nbsp;The model&nbsp;is organized similarly to the INET Framework, and it is currently in alpha status. Three control network systems are available now: Ethernet, ControlNet and DeviceNet. A fourth will be integrated soon: LonTalk.</P>
<P>The model framework was developed under GNU/Linux, but with slight modifications it is also runnable under Windows and MacOS X. Please report me your porting success!</P>
<P>The project is hosted on berlios.de. The Berlios platform is a German initiative providing support for different interest groups in the area of Open Source Software (OSS). Its functions are very similar to those of sourceforge.net and it's free.</P>
<P>Developers needed! Are you interested in developing this project? You're welcome! Contact me under <A href="mailto:dragan.isakovic@freenet.de">dragan.isakovic@freenet.de</A>. I'm searching for people who are challenged by developing an open source project.</P>
<P>Regards<BR>Dragan</P>
