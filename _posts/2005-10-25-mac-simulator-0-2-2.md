<P>"With the vastly increased number of users for our software in recent weeks (thanks everyone!) we've managed to find a few bugs, and so the would like to announce a new bugfix release of the MAC Simulator, version 0.2.2.</P>
<P>Changes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Fixes to S-MAC for long-running simulations, and a minor bug with the 'force' variable not being initialised (thanks to Michael Kaufmann)</LI>
<LI>LPL timeout assertion corrected (thanks to Bruno Marchi)</LI>
<LI>Scripts directory has now been cleaned up and documented. This contains basic scripts for doing interpretation of the MAC Simulator logs.</LI>
<LI>"Idle" and "Active" modes are now better described in the documentation.</LI></UL>
<P>It is available at <A href="http://www.consensus.tudelft.nl/software.html"><U><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>http://www.consensus.tudelft.nl/software.html</U></FONT></A><FONT size=2> as before. Thanks for everyone's feedback, it's nice to be able to finally be able to make our internal work into a program that can be used by others.</P>
