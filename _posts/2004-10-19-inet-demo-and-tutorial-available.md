excerpt: <P>A <STRONG>Windows demo</STRONG> of the INET Framework has just been released.
  Installation takes about three mouse clicks <EM>(no OMNeT++ installation or C++
  compiler needed!)</EM>. The GUI makes it <STRONG>suitable for&nbsp;classroom demonstration</STRONG>
  of the TCP/IP protocol family. Full documentation and a step-by-step, illustrated
  <STRONG>Guided Tour tutorial</STRONG> is part of the package. The package can be
  used to <STRONG>simulate your own networks</STRONG>, as long as built-in protocols
  and application models suffice (no C++ compiler or OMNeT++ installation necessary).&nbsp;
