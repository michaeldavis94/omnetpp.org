excerpt: "<P><STRONG>Plove</STRONG> has been completely rewritten under the skin.
  It is no longer a wrapper around grep, awk and gnuplot&nbsp;&nbsp;-- it boasts a
  powerful internal extensible data-flow engine (for filtering and processing output
  vectors before plotting), and a BLT-based plotting window (which allows a multiple
  plots via tabbed window, and these plots are a bit easier to customize than gnuplot-based
  ones were -- oh yes and they allow arbitrary zooming on the fly). [no longer available

<P><STRONG>Plove</STRONG> has been completely rewritten under the skin.

Calculating histograms and cumulative distribution functions and various other refinements will come soon.
<P>What else? opp_msgc now generates the pack/unpack operations so parallel simulation has become a lot more transparent. Plus a couple of bugfixes of course. The test suite (test/core) is supposed to pass completely, except for one little known bug in ev&lt;&lt; w/ Cmdenv.</P>
