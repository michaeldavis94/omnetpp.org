excerpt: The simulation community has been accused for producing many simulation studies
  of bad quality. The mission of the oProbe open source project is to provide an instrument
  that produces statistically sound results at known quality. Stochastic sampling
  from a network of queues demands both confidence and correlation control. An important
  design goal is to be compatible with the OMNeT++ framework without introducing changes
  to this code, as well as making it easy for existing simulators to make use of oProbe.
  The oProbe project introduces a probe module, which is a new simple module in the
  context of OMNeT++. A probe is the instrument that applies a controlled stochastic
  sampling technique. The probe module may have any number of probes. The oProbe project
  supports different interface levels according to the functionality required. Based
  on the FIFO queue example included in the sample directory in OMNeT++, the oProbe
  project provides example code on how the software can be used by existing or upcoming
  OMNeT++ based simulators. [<a href="dmdocuments/oprobeUserGuide.pdf">manual</a>],
