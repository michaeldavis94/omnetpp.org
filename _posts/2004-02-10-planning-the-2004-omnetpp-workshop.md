  in October-November 2004 in Melbourne, Australia at <A href="http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au">CTIE</A>,
  <A href="http://www.monash.edu.au">Monash University</A>. This note is posted here
  so that you have time to think about travel arrangements, or find someone to present
  your work if you cannot make it in person. We understand that this location is more
  convenient if you're near Australia or in Asia, but we sincerely hope that&nbsp;some
  of you will be able to visit from Europe or America as well. We'll post the exact&nbsp;workshop
  date on this page as we progress with planning.
