We are very happy to announce that OMNeT++ 6.0 preview 12 has been
released. Compatibility updates for INET will be released in
the coming days.

This prerelease contains many small changes and improvements. An ARM (aarch64)
Linux download is also available, and can be used as a base for ARM-based Docker
images (or run directly on your Raspberry Pi). The Linux aarch64 variant can be
used also to run natively on ARM-based MACs in Docker, as long as you have an X
server installed.
