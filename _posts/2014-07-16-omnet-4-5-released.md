excerpt: <p>We are happy to announce that OMNeT++ 4.5 is now available for download.
  The focus of version 4.5 was to improve the usability of the Graphical Runtime Environment
  (Tkenv). The Tkenv GUI has been redesigned for single-window mode to improve usability
  and user experience. A new message logging mode was added in the log window that
  shows the message exchanges in the selected module only. Tkenv has also received
  a new, modern look and feel, due to the use of the Ttk widgets and a custom Ttk
  theme. Read the ChangeLog (after the More link) for details, or <a href="/download/old">go
  directly to the download page</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>single-window mode, with object navigator + 3 built-in inspectors that interact in a meaningful way (new inspector windows can still be opened)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keep inpector windows on top of the main window at all times</p>
</li>

<p>use Ttk widgets everywhere, with custom theme - this makes a huge difference in looks on all platforms but esp. on OS X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BLT no longer needed (we use Ttk instead)</p>

<li>
<p>for each log line, the context module is now stored, and is shown as a line prefix where it makes sense (differs from event’s module)</p>
