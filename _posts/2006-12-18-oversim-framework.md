<P>Ingmar Baumgart (<FONT size=2>Institut für Telematik, Universität Karlsruhe</FONT>) today&nbsp;announced the first release of <STRONG><A href="http://www.oversim.org">OverSim</A></STRONG>, a flexible overlay network simulation framework based on OMNeT++. It was designed to fulfill a number of requirements that have been partially neglected by existing peer-to-peer simulation frameworks.</P></FONT><P>These requirements include the availability of a GUI for debugging purposes, the possibility to exchange models of the underlaying network with different levels of detail and the possibility to reuse protocol implementations for both simulation and real world networks.</P>
<P>Some features of the first release:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Includes implementations of the peer-to-peer protocols Chord and GIA.
<LI>Flexible and modular design (e.g. use of the common API for structured p2p overlays)
<LI>Scalability: Simulation of networks with up to 100,000 nodes</LI></UL>
<P>For screenshots and further information please take a look at the project web site:</P>

<P>OverSim is developed at the Institute of Telematics, Universität Karlsruhe (TH) within the scope of the ScaleNet project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The simulator is actively developed and open to contributions.</P>
