We're happy to announce the 3.1 release of OMNeT++. This version fixes several
problems in the 3.0 release, adds long-awaited sample models for the real-time
and hardware-in-the-loop simulation features, and contains several smaller
improvements such as the possibility to add tooltips to submodule icons. Thanks
all of you who have discovered and reported the problems!
