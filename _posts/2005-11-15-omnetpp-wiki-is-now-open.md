We have set up an OMNeT++ Wiki to help sharing knowledge among the user
community. Wiki is a web site which is editable by everyone. Currently there are
pages about installation issues, some tips and tricks, and about models like MF,
IPv6SuiteWithINET and others -- and anyone can add new pages, or add a few
thoughts to existing ones. We hope that with time, the site will turn into a
valuable knowledge base! [Wiki is no longer available.]
