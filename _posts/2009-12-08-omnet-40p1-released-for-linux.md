We have created a patched version of the OMNeT++ 4.0 (called 4.0.p1), which
works correctly with gcc 4.4.x. On some linux distros the IDE also stopped
responding on first load because of incompatibilities with some versions of
xulrunner (required by firefox). This version now should work without any
problem on recent distributions. The windows version is not affected and the
latest version is still 4.0.
