OMNeT++ 2.3p1 is a bugfix release. It resolves issues of compiling the package
with the Microsoft .NET compiler (aka VC7), contains a number of GNED usability
improvements and bugfixes (thanks to Eric Wu and Steve Woon for the hints), in
Tkenv it makes nested message structures (defined in .msg files) visible in
inspectors. What it doesn't contain yet are the new opp_neddoc, new Tkenv
features such as senddirect animation, the new parallel simulation architecture,
dynamic loading of NED files and other refinements. These features need more
testing and will be available in the next release.
