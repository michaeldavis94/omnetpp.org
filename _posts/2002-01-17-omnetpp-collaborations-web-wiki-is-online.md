excerpt: The <A href="http://cvs-int.etec.uni-karlsruhe.de/twiki/bin/view/OMNETpp/WebHome">OMNeT++
  Collaborations Web Wiki</A>, hosted in Karlsruhe, is online. This is a meeting place
  where people can collaborate on OMNeT++ issues. Anyone can contribute using a regular
  Web browser. It looks like a normal Web site, but it allows (and encourages) everyone
  to edit the web pages and contribute their questions and input. It is simple to
  learn and use, and provides possibly the most powerful way to exchange and develop
  ideas online, in an open, uncomplicated environment.
