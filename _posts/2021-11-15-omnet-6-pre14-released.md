Please welcome the OMNeT++ 6.0 preview 14 release. Along withe this OMNeT++
preview we are releasing INET 3.8.1, 4.2.8 and 4.3.5. These INET versions are
meant to be compatible with OMNeT++ 5.7 and 6.0. Do NOT use earlier versions of
INET with these latest versions on OMNeT++. This prerelease, just about a month
after the previous one, comes with two important improvements in NED, follow-up
changes in the simulation library, and several improvements in Qtenv and the
Analysis Tool in the IDE.
