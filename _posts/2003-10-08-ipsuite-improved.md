excerpt: The first results from the ongoing work to completely review the existing
  IPSuite have been made available. The IPSuite-20031003 release contains the MPLS
  models from UTS as well as full HTML documentation, it compiles both on Linux/gcc
  and Windows/MSVC and has easy-to-maintain, 100% generated makefiles, and has been
  rearranged into a more logical directory structure. Visit <a href="http://ctieware.eng.monash.edu.au/twiki/bin/view/Simulation/IPv4Suite">this
  page</a> for more info about the project.
