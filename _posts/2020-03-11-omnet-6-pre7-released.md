We are happy to announce the seventh preview version of OMNeT++ 6.
This version contains a completely revamped charting solution in the IDE. It is
now based on Python3, with support for displaying Matplotlib charts
right inside the IDE, accessing simulation results in the form of Pandas DataFrames,
and using the built-in (older) charts from Python.

Another important improvement is to allow structured NED parameters with values
specified with a JSON-like syntax.
