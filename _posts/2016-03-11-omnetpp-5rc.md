We are happy to announce that OMNeT++ 5.0 release candidate is available for download. This release brings numerous refinements to APIs introduced in previous beta versions, several bug fixes, and relatively few new features. The manual has been improved and brought up to date for the most part, although there are still gaps that will be filled in for the final 5.0 release. The most conspicuous change will be the new simulation time display in Tkenv and Qtenv.
