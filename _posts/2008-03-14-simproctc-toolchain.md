excerpt: <b><a href="http://www.exp-math.uni-essen.de/~dreibh/omnetpp/">SimProcTC  </a></b>
  is a model-independent, flexible and powerful tool-chain for the setup, parallel
  run execution, results aggregation, data analysis and debugging of OMNeT++-based
  simulations, using Open Source software under Linux. It optionally utilizes the
  Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) implementation <a href="http://tdrwww.exp-math.uni-essen.de/dreibholz/rserpool/">RSPLIB
  </a> for easily setting up simulation processing pools for distributed execution
  of simulation runs. Compared to other approaches like Akaroa, this RSerPool-based
  solution requires minimal configuration effort due to fully automatic configuration
  of the components. SimProcTC was developed by Thomas Dreibholz at the Institute
  for Experimental Mathematics, University of Duisburg-Essen.
